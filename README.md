# Installation
TODO:not yet published.

# What is this

A [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) client for C# which transport metrics to datadog agent. Datadog has [official C# client](https://github.com/DataDog/dogstatsd-csharp-client) but it is not performant. DatadogSharp is more performant and has zero-overhead api.

Additionaly supports [Datadog APM](https://www.datadoghq.com/apm/) API for [Datadog trace agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent). This is only C# SDK which supports APM.

> But not yet implemented:)
